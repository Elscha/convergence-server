  Adds a availability field to the Domain class to seaparate the schema status
  from the user intended mode (e.g. offline, online, etc.). This also adds
  a schema version field to simplify the logic of getting the  current version.

actions:

  ##
  ## 1. Assume the intention of all domains is online since that was the only
  ##    intention previously. Also, set the domain status to ready for
  ##    any domain that is currently online.
  ##

  - action: RunSqlCommand
    command: |-
      UPDATE Domain SET availability = "online";
      UPDATE Domain SET status = "ready" WHERE status == "online";

  ##
  ## 2. Add the availability property to the Domain class.
  ##
  - action: AddProperty
    className: Domain
    property: {name: availability, type: String, constraints: { mandatory: true, notNull: true }}

  ##
  ## 3. Set all domains to version 1.0, since the only version of the schema
  ##    that did not have this field was 1.0
  - action: RunSqlCommand
    command: |-
      UPDATE Domain SET databaseSchemaVersion = "1.0"

  ##
  ## 4. Add the databaseSchemaVersion property to the Domain class. now that
  ##    all domains have the property.
  ##
  - action: AddProperty
    className: Domain
    property: {name: databaseSchemaVersion, type: String, constraints: { mandatory: true, notNull: true }}

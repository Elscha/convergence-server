  Updates the indices for the UserRole table. The code assumes that a given
  user can only have one role per target. However, the existing index is
  unique on only user, target AND, role.  This does not prevent a user from
  having more than one role for a target, which is not desireable. This delta
  removes the existing with all three attributes, and replaces it with on
  that is unique only on user and target.

actions:

  ## 1. Add the index.
